Design decisions:
-----------------

This website follows the flat and minimalist design style.
For the color and font of the website, I used Google Material Design's color and font.
The color and font are related to youtube's color theme.
Since this is an application for getting youtube's videos, I believe the colors match the purpose of tha app.

For the layout of the website, I created a fixed top bar containing title and dropdown menu, this way
user will be able to choose other artists from the dropdown menu even when they are in the middle of the page.
The videos are displayed in a list video, I didn't put the title of the video since the youtube video already has
the title on the video.

If I had more time, I would create a load more button and load more videos if we set the list to more than 5 videos


Thoughts:
-------------

The major difficulty I had was learning about youtube api and connect the api with node.js.
In the begining I was only able to get the videos ids from search result, I later discovered that I can add
parameters and filter only the playlists. Then I used the getPlayListsItemsById from youtube api to get the items in the playlist.
