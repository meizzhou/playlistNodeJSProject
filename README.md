Create a node.js application consisting of a single playlist module with YouTubeâ€™s public search API: 
https://developers.google.com/youtube/v3/docs/search

Basic product requirements :
Simple playlist of finite set of videos.
A dropdown to choose from different artists. 
Eg : List : [Elton John, Stevie Wonder, Frank Sinatra, Louis Armstrong];
By default the first item in the dropdown should be selected and the corresponding playlist should be rendered server side. Change in selection should trigger client side updates.
Design/ Presentation of the module is entirely upto you.
